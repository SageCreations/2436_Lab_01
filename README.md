# 2436_Lab_01
Lab_01 for 2436


This lab is basically the combination of problems #2 and #3 from the programming Exercises section of Chapter 16. However, the wording for this lab is much clearer than that of the textbook, so use this writeup for lab instructions.

a. Write a function to find and delete the node with the smallest info in the list. (Delete only the first occurrence and traverse the list only once.)

b. Write a function to Find and delete all occurrences of a given info from the list. (Traverse the list only once.)

Add the definition of these as abstract functions in the class linkedListType
and provide the implementation of these functions in the class
unorderedLinkedList.

c. Write a function that returns the info of the kth element of the
linked list. If no such element exists, terminate the program.

b. Write a function that deletes the kth element of the linked list. If
no such element exists, terminate the program.

Provide the definitions and implementation of these functions in the class linkedListType.

A test program ( testLinkedList.cpp ) has been provided to test these functions. The initially invalid tests are commented out. When you have written your functions, uncomment these tests to determine if they work correctly. This is an example of Test Driven Development - albeit low tech TDD.
